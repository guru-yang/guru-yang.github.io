						<h3>Meerkat</h3>
						<p>"Meerkat" is a computational tool to identify genomic rearrangements from high-throughput sequencing data. It uses multiple clusters of discordant reads to identify more complex rearrangements than available methods and uses split-reads to ensure high accuracy, followed by analysis of sequence homology at the breakpoints. The mechanisms forming these rearrangements can be inferred based on the features of breakpoints.
