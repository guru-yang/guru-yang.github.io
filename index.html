			<p>The Yang Lab is battling on the frontiers of precision medicine. We focus mostly on human cancer, and are also interested in non-cancer human diseases as well. We develop new computational methods to integrate the large scale genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic and clinical data to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis, to discover new drug targets, and eventually, to help patients.</p>
